/**
Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}

var frequencySort = function (s) {
  const map = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    map.set(s[i], map.get(s[i]) + 1 || 1);
  }

  const sortedMap = new Map([...map.entries()].sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]));

  let ans = "";
  sortedMap.forEach((val, key) => {
    ans += key.repeat(val);
  });

  return ans;
};

console.log(frequencySort("tree"));
console.log(frequencySort("cccaaa"));
console.log(frequencySort("Aabb"));
